# Analysis of 25 designated cancer centers as mandated by the DOH

The goal is to create a visualization using these list:

1. Number of equipment needed per 1M population
2. Suggested number per 1M population
3. Philippine Cancer Cases of 2022
4. Population of Cancer Patients

## Install libraries using pip

Follow this step:


```python
pip install pandas matplotlib
```

    The history saving thread hit an unexpected error (OperationalError('attempt to write a readonly database')).History will not be written to the database.
    Defaulting to user installation because normal site-packages is not writeable


## Import all libraries needed

These are the dependencies:
1. pandas
2. matplotlib


```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## 1. Number of equipment needed per 1M population



```python
# Load data from CSV
df = pd.read_csv("cancer_cases(noEquipmentNeeded).csv")

# Set 'Region (as of 2022)' as the index to use region names for the x-axis
df.set_index("Region\n(as of 2022)", inplace=True)

# Select only equipment columns for the stacked bar plot
equipment_columns = ["CT Scan", "LINAC", "Digital Mammogram", "MRI", "Brachy", "PET Scan"]

# Plotting the stacked bar chart
df[equipment_columns].plot(kind="bar", stacked=True, figsize=(10, 6))

# Adding labels and title
plt.xlabel("Region")
plt.ylabel("Equipment Units")
plt.title("Number of Equipment needed per 1M population")
plt.legend(title="Equipment Type", bbox_to_anchor=(1.05, 1), loc='upper left')
plt.tight_layout()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## 2. Suggested number per 1M population



```python
# Load the data from the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('cancer_cases(suggestedEquipment).csv')

# Handle NaN values: Fill NaN with 0 (or drop rows if necessary)
df['Suggested # per 1M population'].fillna(0, inplace=True)  # Or use df.dropna(subset=['Suggested # per 1M population'], inplace=True)

# Ensure the column is numeric, converting any non-numeric values to NaN
df['Suggested # per 1M population'] = pd.to_numeric(df['Suggested # per 1M population'], errors='coerce')

# Plotting the pie chart
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
wedges, texts, autotexts = plt.pie(df['Suggested # per 1M population'], labels=df['EQUIPMENT'], autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=140)

# Customizing the labels inside the pie chart
for autotext in autotexts:
    autotext.set_color('white')  # Set the text color to white
    autotext.set_fontweight('bold')  # Make the font bold for better visibility

# Adding legend on the right
plt.legend(df['EQUIPMENT'], title="Equipment", loc="center left", bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0, 0.5, 1))
plt.title("Suggested Medical Equipment Distribution per 1M Population")

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

## 3. Philippine Cancer Cases of 2022



```python
# Load the data from the CSV file
df = pd.read_csv('cancer_cases(cancerCases).csv')

# Drop the extra column if there are 3 columns and rename the remaining columns
df = df.iloc[:, :2]  # Select only the first two columns (Case Type and Count)
df.columns = ['Case Type', 'Population']  # Rename the columns

# Plotting the bar chart
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
bars = plt.bar(df['Case Type'], df['Population'], color=['blue', 'red', 'green'])

# Adding labels inside the bars
for bar in bars:
    yval = bar.get_height()
    # Placing the label in the center of the bar
    plt.text(bar.get_x() + bar.get_width()/2, yval/2,  # Adjust position to the center
             f'{yval}', ha='center', va='center', color='white', fontweight='bold')

# Adding title and labels
plt.title('Cancer Cases Overview')
plt.xlabel('Case Type')
plt.ylabel('Population')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

# Create DataFrame for the bar chart

# Set up the bar chart
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 6))

## Findings




1. ### Number of equipment needed per 1M population.
- The results shows that regions with higher populations, such as NCR (National Capital Region) with 13.48 million people and Region 4-A (CALABARZON) with 16.2 million people, show proportionally higher counts of medical imaging equipment (CT Scans, LINAC, MRI, Digital Mammograms, etc.).
- Regions such as Region 3 (Central Luzon), Region 6 (Western Visayas), and Region 7 (Central Visayas) have moderate populations (5-12 million) and display relatively proportional levels of equipment. For instance, Region 7 has 80.8 CT Scans and MRI units each, reflecting its population size.
- Regions with lower populations, such as CAR (Cordillera Administrative Region) and Region 13 (CARAGA), exhibit significantly fewer resources, with 18-28 units for each equipment type. This disparity points to potential challenges in access to healthcare technology for residents in these areas.
  
2. ### Suggested number per 1M population
- CT Scanners: Suggested at 10 units per 1 million population. This reflects the need for widely available CT services, which are commonly used for diagnostic imaging in multiple medical conditions.
- Linear Accelerators (LINAC): Suggested at 1 unit per 1 million population. LINACs are used primarily in radiation therapy for cancer patients, indicating a specialized yet less frequently needed service compared to diagnostic equipment.
- Digital Mammograms: Suggested at 5 units per 1 million population. This recommendation reflects the necessity for screening tools in preventive care, especially in breast cancer detection.
- MRI Machines: Suggested at 10 units per 1 million population. This number aligns with the high demand for MRI in diagnostics, similar to CT scans, due to its extensive applications across various medical conditions.
- Brachytherapy Units (Brachy): Suggested at 1 unit per 1 million population. Brachytherapy, used for localized cancer treatments, is a specialized service, hence the low recommended count.
- PET Scanners: Suggested at 1 unit per 1 million population. PET scans are generally used in oncology and neurology, reflecting the need for specific but essential diagnostic capabilities for complex conditions.

3. ### Philippine Cancer Cases of 2022
- New Cases: There are 188,976 new cases reported within the population. This figure highlights the current incidence rate of the condition and suggests a high need for timely diagnosis and early intervention to manage new cases effectively.
- Deaths: With 113,369 deaths recorded, this number indicates a significant mortality rate, suggesting that the condition has severe impacts on the populationâ€™s health. This may underscore the need for enhanced preventive measures, early treatment, and potentially more resources for palliative and end-of-life care.
- Prevalent Cases: The number of 466,012 prevalent cases suggests a large population of individuals living with the condition, either

4. ### Population of Cancer Patients
- The population is nearly balanced between males and females, with only a slight difference of approximately 390,593 more males than females. The total population across both sexes is 112,508,991.
- There were a total of 188,976 new cancer cases reported, with females accounting for a higher number of new cases (105,912) compared to males (83,064).Females have about 22,848 more new cases than males, indicating a higher incidence rate in females.
- Cancer deaths are almost equally distributed between males (56,863) and females (56,506), with only a slight difference of 357 more deaths in males. The total number of cancer-related deaths across both sexes is 113,369, which is about 60% of the new cases reported, suggesting a significant mortality impact from cancer.\
- The mortality rate, calculated as deaths relative to new cases, is slightly higher in males (approximately 68.5%) than in females (around 53.4%). This suggests that males with cancer might have a slightly higher risk of death compared to females.
